# (i) MOV AX 3d
The instruction is missing a comma between the destination and the source. 
The correct syntax is: MOV AX,3d

# (ii) MOV 23, AX
In this instruction tries to move the value in AX into the immediate value 23, which is wrong.
we can't move a register value into immediate value.

# (iii) MOV CX, CH
trying to move the value of CH (the high byte of the CX register) into the CX register. 
But this is not allowed because CH is part of CX.

# (iv) MOVE AX, 1h
in this instruction , the instruction is wrong there is error in mov instruction spalling.

# (v) ADD 2, CX
Operand order is wrong; immediate value must be  at source it can't be destination.

# (vi) ADD 3, 6
Both operands are immediate values; the destination one must be a register or memory location.

# (vii) INC AX, 2
only increments by 1, not by other values.
